///This function uses the Vector3 class in Unity to perform the dot product and cross product operations, and the Mathf class to perform the square root and absolute value operations. It takes in a playerTransform representing the player's transform, an array of colliderVertices representing the vertices of the collider, and a deathThreshold representing the distance below the collider at which the player is considered to have fallen to their death.

///Note that you will need to attach this script to a game object in your Unity scene and set the appropriate values for the playerTransform, colliderVertices, and deathThreshold fields. You may also need to modify the function depending on the specifics of your game and collider.
